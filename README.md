# Face-Mask-Detection

Problem Statement :- 
Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases, as is one of the few precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of immunization. With this model, it is possible to detect people wearing masks, or not wearing them.

Datasets :- 
The dataset provided consists of training data, validation data and testing data for both the categories.

Dependencies :- 
Jupyter Notebook
Tensorflow
Python 3.6
Numpy
vgg19 Pretrained Model
haar cascade to detect faces

Solutions :- 
The algorithm was trained on well classified and labelled image data consisting of 4290 images.
